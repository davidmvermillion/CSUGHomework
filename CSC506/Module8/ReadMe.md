# File Descriptions

[bubblysort.py]() is a bidirectional bubble sorting algorithm \
[SampleGeneration.ipynb]() generates the associated pickle files with performance values for bidirectional bubble, heap, and merge sorting algorithms. \
[SampleAnalysis.ipynb]() generates the graphs showcasing the algorithm performances. \
The three pickle files save the data for later to keep them out of memory. You can generate them yourself from the SampleGeneration notebook if you have concerns about cybersecurity in executing the hosted pickle files.
